So all in all, the loop shouldn't take much longer than all the execution-times for adding trades combined right? In my example that would be 0,1073 milliseconds. Instead the loop takes a total of more than 1,5 seconds which would be 10,000x the amount that I'd expect. I actually have zero clue what's happening here. And this is a severe problem for my program because the code-fragment is executed about 100,000 times, so 150,000 seconds would be 40 hours of performance-loss :(</p>\n"

You could use a different serialization format (e.g. a JSON string) rather than the custom binary format used here.  That might be good if you need compatibility with other applications.  I won't demonstrate an alternative string serialization using JSON here though.</p>\n<p>It is possible to place multiple entries in the <code>DragBoard</code> for the same item, with each entry providing a different representation of the same data.  I did that here, using a custom data format for the binary data and a string format, which just invokes <code>toString</code> on the item.  If you drag within the app, which understands the binary format, the app can use the binary format.  However, if you drag to something outside the app, which won't understand the custom format, it will fall back to the string format.  This can be seen by dragging items from the example into a text editor.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>so i can make this work with Classes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a class, generate <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code> functions using your IDE and use equals instead of <code>==</code> to test equivalence, so that you avoid some of the issues mentioned by John Bollinger.</p>\n<p>For a record you don't need to write the hashing and equals functions, or the accessor functions as the records provide them.</p>\n<p>Other than that, most of the implementation is the same regardless of whether you choose to use records or classes.</p>\n"

Wolfram Alpha gets that right, anyway at 599, but on other platforms you may need to look at it as ((10^9 mod 2017)<em>(10^8 mod 2017))mod 2017 to get the 599. You also need that 58184241583791680 mod 2017 is 2005 (again Wolfram gets this right, but lesser platforms may falter if you do not break it up into something like (((581842415 mod 2017)</em>(10^8 mod 2017) mod 2017)+83791680)mod 2017.</p>\n\n<p>So at each step of the (58184241583791680 but no fear) process you are taking your current number and multiplying it by 10^17 (to move it over to make room for the concatenation) and adding 58184241583791680. But we can do this all mod 2017. In the language of sequences a sub 1 = 2005 and a sub (n+1)=((a sub n)*599+2005) mod 2017.\nThat is the key step in your for loop. I did the first 4040 or so terms in R (got to love that you can just lay them out on screen interactively and pore over them -- the language is growing on me), though it really would have sufficed to do about half that (the good old Pigeonhole principle at work). And they do not cycle until you actually get all the way out to a sub 2017 which is 2005 again. So is a sub 4033.</p>\n\n<p>In general a sub n = a sub (n mod 2016). You want a sub 58184241583791680. 58184241583791680 mod 2016 is 224 says Wolfram Alpha [again on a lesser platform you may need to break it up into (((581842415 mod 2016)*(10^8 mod 2016) mod 2016)+83791680)mod 2016], so you want a sub 224.</p>\n\n<p>If people want to check themselves or me, I got on R that that was 465. But as was pointed out above, the process is what the question is really interested in.</p>\n"

The error does not appear, if server and client are the same device!</p>\n<p>So my question is: How can the result (and integrity) of this TCP transaction depend on the execution speed of the program on the server side and size of the buffer that is sent?</p>\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> By execution speed, I mean the optional added <code>System.out.println()</code> statements in the server program, which sometimes somehow determine whether the client receives the buffer successfully or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong>\nJust by running the server on my pc, and the client on my Laptop while varying the sent buffer size and repeating each for 3 times, I got these outputs:</p>\n<p><em>server: &quot;sending: 2000 bytes&quot;</em>\n<em>client: &quot;expected length: 2000&quot; &quot;received buffer length: 0(first try, 2000 second try, 0 third try)&quot;</em></p>\n<p><em>server: &quot;sending: 8192 bytes&quot;</em>\n<em>client: &quot;expected length: 8192&quot; &quot;received buffer length: 6(first try, 0 second try, 8192 third try)&quot;</em></p>\n<p><em>server: &quot;sending: 20000 bytes&quot;</em>\n<em>client: &quot;expected length: 20000&quot; &quot;received buffer length: 11808(first try, 11808 second try, 11808 third try)&quot;</em></p>\n<p><em>server: &quot;sending: 100000 bytes&quot;</em>\n<em>client: &quot;expected length: 100000&quot; &quot;received buffer length: 91808(first try, 91808 second try, 91808 third try)&quot;</em></p>\n<p><em>server: &quot;sending: 1000000 bytes&quot;</em>\n<em>client: &quot;expected length: 1000000&quot; &quot;received buffer length: 998540(first try, 1000000 second try, 991808 third try)&quot;</em></p>\n"

Now you're comfortable with it, but if you do another project and come back in 6 months you will understand what I mean.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem that you face in the modelling is that UML aims to help you provide clarity on your design, and not to visually program what's already in the code.</p>\n<h3>How to solve it?</h3>\n<p>I understand that the <code>config</code> in your <code>School</code> is in fact a set of config parameters, each identified by a unique key for a given school:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The config property must be a struct like a Hashmap&lt;String, String&gt; (Java) or dict[str, str] (Python)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are two approaches, both with config removed from the school attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>use a qualifier (the small rectangle with a qualifier attribute <code>Key:String</code>) directly for the <code>School</code>, and associate it with a <code>String</code>,  or better with a <code>ConfigurationParameter</code> which would be a string, but could evolve into something more complex later.  This would be very close to your implementation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>abstract from the way you implemented your configuration, and associate one school to many <code>ConfigurationElements</code>, which would be a class with a property <code>key</code>, and a property <code>parameter</code> both being strings.  This would allow other implementations as just the <code>Hashmap</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the more complex <code>Hashmap&lt;String, Hasmap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;</code>, it's more challenging:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the students object must be a Hashmap&lt;String, Hasmap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; (Java) or in Python dict[str, dict[str, str]] for instance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First of all, I see a <code>School</code> class and no <code>Student</code> class. But I see that you use a <code>students</code> property and note the plural. And you use a type M2D which we see you try to associate with a qualifier to something. So I think that your design forgets to show the design intent.  If the school has many students, then associate your school with a <code>Student</code> class.  Again:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you could use a qualified association (e.g. if a student ID allows to find exactly one student for a school).  I'll use this in my diagram</li>\n<li>or you coud use a simple one to many association. This seems a better approach if the school acts as a kind of repository for the students, and if beyond a <code>getSudentdById(...):Student</code> you'd also want dome more creative queries, e.g. <code>getStudentsByAge(...):Student[*]</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, if your <code>Student</code> is implemented as a set of pair values (e.g. you don't want properties of a student to be fixed,  but dynamic),  then associate the <code>Student</code> with a qualifier to the <code>StudentAttribute</code> class which is a string.</p>\n<p>The advantage is that this modelling makes the navigation in the <code>Hashmap&lt;String, Hasmap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;</code> much clearer:  the first string gives a student,  the second string gives an attribute of a student which is a string.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/me1YM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/me1YM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\nOf course, you could remove the intermediates and associated directly to string, like the hashmap do,  but then you should at least add a comment to explain what the association with String is supposed to convey as information.</p>\n"

If thread A performs a truly atomic operation, then any other thread B that shares variables with thread A should only ever be able to see those variables in the state that they were before the operation started, or in the state after thread A completed the operation. Thread B should never be able to see the variables in a half-way-done state.</p>\n<p>I think it's the ambiguous &quot;all or nothing&quot; that made you think about transactions.</p>\n<p>Your example code throws an exception 10% of the time. If you're using that exception as a model of &quot;failure,&quot; and you're expecting that the <code>x++</code> operation will be &quot;unwound&quot; when a failure occurs, that's not how it's going to work. &quot;Atomic&quot; and &quot;transactional&quot; are <em>related,</em> because the completion of a transaction must happen atomically, but the words mean different things.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to guarantee that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> always receive the same number of increments, even in the face of failure, then until somebody gives us true transactions, you'll have to write explicit code to provide that guarantee:</p>\n<pre><code>    public synchronized void add(){\n        x++;\n        try {\n            someOperationThatMightFail();\n        }\n        catch (Exception e) {\n            --x;\n            throw e;\n        }\n        y++;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the below code is atomic...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not <em>really</em> atomic. It could be <em>effectively</em> atomic, but only if no other thread ever accesses the same <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> except when <code>synchronized</code> on the same object. If it were truly atomic, then it would be impossible, under <em>any</em> conditions, for another thread to observe <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> at a moment when the <code>add</code> call was only half-way done. But, if the programmer guarantees that every other thread synchronizes on the same object when accessing those variables, then it has the same effect <em>as if</em> it truly was atomic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...but it has side effects...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't see the &quot;but&quot; in that. Atomicity means nothing unless there are variables shared between the threads. What you're calling &quot;side effects&quot; is how the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are shared.</p>\n"

After the atomic method was executed successfully, the changes are visible to all threads. The atomic method only modifies data of its own object without side effects. Here are some examples of atomic methods.&quot; It seems to me this definition is not necessarily correct.

Which I don't understand as I am trying to convert <code>B</code> to <code>A</code> not <code>A</code> to <code>B</code></p>\n<p>I have tried changing the parameter type from a <code>Function&lt;A, String&gt;</code> to a</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Function&lt;? extends A, String&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>but alas this doesn't work either.</p>\n<p>Is there some way I can achieve passing either a <code>Function&lt;A, String&gt;</code> or a <code>Function&lt;B, String&gt;</code> into the same argument?</p>\n<p>I am creating a game using the Swing library, and my <code>A</code> is <code>Displayable</code> and <code>B</code> is <code>Purchasable</code>. I have a class <code>DisplayablePanel</code> which extends <code>JPanel</code> and creates a visual representation of any displayable object in my game. All <code>Purchasables</code> are <code>Displayable</code> so I can display them using my <code>DisplayPanel</code> however, I want <code>Purchasables</code> to be able to display <code>Purchasable</code> specific information too. Here my constructor uses the <code>Function&lt;A, String&gt;</code> to decide what text should be displayed on a button that sits on the <code>DisplayPanel</code> And for my <code>Purchasable</code>s this information is specific to the <code>Purchasable</code> interface</p>\n"

(another 42 ceros) ... 00</p>\n<p>So the first 9 bits are correct, but the following 53 bits shouldn't be there, and are cero. If I were to leave it like this this is what the decoded text would look like:</p>\n<p>aaabbcaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...</p>\n<p>very different from the original. One way to fix this would be to include the correct size of the encoded message in the CompressFile class, so when I decompress it, I only check the exact number of bits, but I want to know if there is a way to not have to save this integer in the class (this would save me 8 bytes, not much in the grand scheme of things, coming to be 8 chars, but the purpose is to use as less memory as possible). Still if there is no other way, I will put that original size into the CompressedFile class.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for the help :)</p>\n"

The artifact was renamed to that starting with <code>1.0</code> (different from <code>1</code>), but the classes were kept in the <code>javax.inject</code> package for backwards compatibility.  Starting with <code>2.0.0</code>, the classes are now in the <code>jakarta.inject</code> package.</p>\n<p>It's possible to pull in both the old v1 artifact and v2.0.0+ of the new artifact if you need to support both packages, which is a fairly common case in large projects with a mix of older and newer dependencies.  Maven config:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;javax.inject&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.inject&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.inject&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.inject-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Note also that there are alternative providers of these classes.  Some of the ones most likely to run into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>javax:javaee-api</code>, as mentioned in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/15315850/507761\">Darko's answer</a></li>\n<li><code>javax.inject:inject</code></li>\n<li><code>javax.inject:inject-api</code></li>\n<li><code>javax.inject:jsr330-api</code>, and <em>many</em> other artifacts with <code>jsr330</code> in the name</li>\n<li><code>org.glassfish.hk2.external:javax.inject</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I recommend <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/bannedDependencies.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">using <code>maven-enforcer-plugin</code> to ban</a> these dependencies.  When it detects them and fails, you can add <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html#dependency-exclusions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dependency exclusions</a> to prevent them from being pulled in transitively.  Just make sure to have an explicit dependency on the official version replacing it; otherwise, you may hit runtime issues.</p>\n<p>There are also shaded versions bundled into other libraries that move the classes into an entirely different package; there's nothing you can do about that (at least not simply), but it should be fine since they won't conflict.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Finally, note that while modern versions of <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guice\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Guice injection framework</a> support one or both of the official implementations (Jakarta support was added in Guice 6.0 and 7.0), support was somewhat lacking in older versions.  If you use an older version of Guice (prior to 4.2 in my experience), you might need to use their version: <code>com.google.inject.Inject</code> from <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.inject/guice\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>com.google.inject:guice</code></a>.</p>\n"

From your use of <code>unescapeEntities</code> I am guessing that you are presenting this as plain text -- e.g. in a text email body? Or you have another layer in presentation that is re-encoding HTML entities before presenting in HTML? The context matters and could impact what steps are required.</p>\n<p>A string like <code>&quot;;alert('XSS');//</code> is potentially dangerous if used unescaped in a HTML attribute.</p>\n<p>My suggestion would be - simplify the flow and clarify if the output of the function is meant to be plain text or HTML. If it's plain text, I would do something like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String getSanitizedPlainText(String inputHtml) {\n  String text = Jsoup.parse(inputHtml).body().text(); \n  // or .wholeText() to preserve newlines\n  return text;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then the output is cleaned and safe for use in plain text contexts; and if you want to present it in HTML, encode any entities (using e.g. your HTML templating engine).</p>\n<p>This pattern doesn't really make sense to me:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String sanitizedStr=Jsoup.clean(esapiValue,Safelist.simpleText());\nsanitizedStr=Parser.unescapeEntities(sanitizedStr,false);\n</code></pre>\n<p>As the result of <code>.clean()</code> is HTML and you are then unEscaping. Just skip that double step and use one of the <code>.text()</code> methods instead.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>After your edit, it's still not clear to me what content your input is (HTML, or?), and what context you want to display the output in.</p>\n<p>I would break down the decision tree as:</p>\n<p>1: if your input is HTML, and you want to keep it as HTML and make it safe, use the <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jsoup HTML Cleaner</a>. You can optionally control what tags and attributes to preserve. The output is HTML.\n2: if your input is HTML, but you only want the text content: use a <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/nodes/Element.html#text()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">text(</a>) method (and if the output context is a HTML body, escape it in your presentation layer)\n3: otherwise, if your input is just text, don't do anything on input, and escape it if neccesarry on output.</p>\n<p>If you are using multiple methods (like in your original example of using ESAPI, then jsoup HTML cleaning and keeping only textnodes, then unescaping and converting that from HTML to plain text) -- I feel your problem statement or solution design is under-specified and it needs a re-think. I would expect to see only one step, as outlined in the list before.</p>\n<p>Or, you need to more crisply define what is &quot;malicious&quot;. In your earlier example (which you removed on edit), the strings which were emitted were not dangerous if using in an HTML body context or a plain-text context. That one of the methods changed the input string doesn't make it necessarily malicious, IMV. But you could define what you consider an attack (vs just a string getting escaped or whatever) and additionally scan for that. I.e, consider two distinct passes: one over the input to decide if you think there's an &quot;attack&quot;, and a second (which always need to run, regardless of the output of the earlier) to just normalize and sanitize the input, following the decision tree I mentioned above.</p>\n"

          "body": "<p>First off, the best defense against XSS is to use proper contextual output encoding, not HTML sanitization, which is essentially what you are doing here. HTML sanitization is intended when it is not possible to do output encoding because you have a requirement that you must accept certain (HTML) markup. An example would be something like a rich text editor that you often finds in text fields, such as the one that that Stack Overflow uses to accept this answer. And even then, if you must accept markup, it's important that you only accept <em>safe</em> markup. Unfortunately, the way that Jsoup works is rather than recognizing only safe markup, it tries to prevent someone from entering unsafe markup. (That is, it operates as a block-list rather than an allow-list.) And a block-list approach is a game that you cannot possibly win. If you really must use HTML santization, a better than approach would be to use one that uses an allow-list approach. So something like <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-antisamy/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP AntiSamy</a> or the <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer</a> would both be much better and safer choices than Jsoup. That said, if you have some select input that you need cleaned, you can use a combination of ESAPI with AntiSamy via one of the various <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/static/org.owasp.esapi/esapi/2.5.2.0/org/owasp/esapi/Validator.html#getValidSafeHTML-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-int-boolean-org.owasp.esapi.ValidationErrorList-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Validator.getValidSafeHTML</a> methods. As noted in the Javadoc, Validator.getValidSafeHTML</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Returns canonicalized and validated &quot;safe&quot; HTML that does not contain unwanted scripts in the body, attributes, CSS, URLs, or anywhere else, any validation exceptions are added to the supplied errorList.</p>\n<p>The default behavior of this check depends on the antisamy-esapi.xml configuration. Implementors should reference the OWASP AntiSamy project for ideas on how to do HTML validation in a whitelist way, as this is an extremely difficult problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, that still is not advised over general contextual output encoding, but it will be better than what you have.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I would advise you to thoroughly read through the ESAPI GitHub wiki page &quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/wiki/XSS-Defense:-No-Silver-Bullets\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">XSS Defense: No Silver Bullets</a>&quot;. It will describe why doing what you are attempting (mostly documented under the &quot;Interceptors&quot; section) is an anti-pattern that ought to be avoided except as an absolute last resort.</p>\n"

I expect it to be subRatings=[&quot;Coarse Language&quot;] instead.</p>\n<p>I have a tried a few things, but so far the one that gets me closest to what I want is using jaxb bindings like the below:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;jxb:bindings schemaLocation=&quot;media.xsd&quot; node=&quot;//xs:complexType[@name='ratingType']&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;jxb:bindings node=&quot;.//xs:attribute[@name='subRatings']&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;jxb:property&gt;\n                &lt;jxb:baseType&gt;\n                    &lt;xjc:javaType name=&quot;java.util.List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&quot; adapter=&quot;org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.CommaDelimitedStringAdapter&quot;/&gt;\n                &lt;/jxb:baseType&gt;\n            &lt;/jxb:property&gt;\n        &lt;/jxb:bindings&gt;\n    &lt;/jxb:bindings&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The generated class has the following attribute definition:</p>\n<pre><code>@XmlAttribute(name = &quot;subRatings&quot;)\n    @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(CommaDelimitedStringAdapter.class)\n    protected List&lt;String&gt;subRatings;\n</code></pre>\n<p>All good so far. However, for some reason, jaxb adds this import to the class: <code>import java.util.List&lt;String&gt;;</code> which causes it to not compile.</p>\n<p>Other thing that I tried was removing the specific type in the javaType name definition, like <code>java.util.List</code> but that causes jaxb to create the field with a raw type like <code>protected List subRatings;</code> and that's not only ugly but it causes issues downstream as now anyone using this class needs to cast the subrating object making the code smelly. Any ideas how to overcome this? Keep in mind that I cannot modify the generated classes as they are built at compile time.</p>\n"
